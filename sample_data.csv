Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine: comparison with exercise-induced ischemia,The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease. Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise.,cardiovascular
Brain tumor classification using convolutional neural networks,Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in medical image analysis particularly for brain tumor detection and classification. We developed a CNN-based model for automatic brain tumor classification from MRI scans.,neurological
